# DigiChem_Wei_Dai_Project

This branch contains all the machine learning datasets and the jupyter notebooks, to use all the codes, first you have to unzip the machine learning dataset, and put all the datasets together with the notebooks.
For all the notebooks, the “Example_codes_for_project” contains all the codes for the project, so if you want to know the whole process, read this notebook is enough, if you want to try the actual process, “feature extraction” notebook means the nanopore descriptor generation part, “supervised learning” notebooks focused on machine learning training and testing and analysis, “NN_further_try” notebooks are the CNN notebooks, for all the notebooks, there are two versions, length version and voltage version.
Do remember unzip the experimental datasets in the experimental_datasets branch as well!
